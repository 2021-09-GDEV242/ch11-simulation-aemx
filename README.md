# Ch10-Simulator
## About the Eagle Class
- Eagles prey on foxes and rabbits, which provide about as much sustenance as rabbits do for foxes
- Eagles have a relatively short maximum lifespan of 50
- Eagles begin to breed at age 10, and do so until death, 40 total
- Their litter size is the smallest of the three animals at 1
## Assumptions
- Eagles can make simulations last much longer than normal
- Eagles will typically take out the fox population before trying to overcome the rabbit population
- However, eagles cannot keep up with a rapidly growing rabbit population, and go extinct eventually
